## ðŸ“˜ 2/5 Step-by-Step Process

From a user's story outline to a complete novel, this system ensures that every chapter weaves seamlessly into the next, presenting a sequence diagram and a high-level architecture to illustrate this iterative process.

## ðŸ“˜ 3/5 Crafting the Narrative

Starting with a prompt and specific user inputs such as:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Flickan och katten bor tillsammans i en lÃ¤genhet. Flickan gillar att rita och katten ...",
  "num_chapters": 5,
  "writing_style": "koselig, naivistisk, tÃ¸ysete, tredjeperson, mye dialog, av astrid lindgren"
}
```

The system embarks on a journey to craft a narrative with a specified number of chapters and a writing style that's cozy, naive, playful, in third-person, and dialogue-rich, evoking the spirit of Astrid Lindgren.

## ðŸ“˜ 4/5 Editorial and Stylistic Refinement

An 'editorial office' agent hones the language, and a style-describing agent maintains originality, avoiding specific literary references to create a unique narrative voice.

## ðŸ“˜ 5/5 From Text to EPUB

In just five minutes, our system delivers a meticulously processed novel, compiled into EPUB and PDF formats. Additionally, with the integration of text-to-speech multilingual models, the novel is available in delightful Swedish, and for English, one can enjoy the auditory experience here: [Tardigrade Tango](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1c6uiRekAM&t=255s&ab_channel=JifUniversal).
