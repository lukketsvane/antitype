In the realm of artificial intelligence, the conversation oscillates between unparalleled optimism and cautionary pessimism. This dichotomy is captured in the metric known as **P(DOOM)** versus **P(WIN)**, which quantifies the probability of AI leading humanity to a catastrophic failure or a utopian future, respectively. Recent advancements in AI have pushed this dialogue to the forefront, with thought leaders and technologists earnestly calculating our odds.

The concept of P(DOOM) is not merely an esoteric exercise but a pragmatic approach to understanding the stakes of AI development. It underscores the urgency of aligning AI systems with human values to avert potential disasters. The term, becoming increasingly tweetable thanks to voices like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, puts forth a stark number—ranging from 10 to 25 percent—highlighting the perceived risk of an AI-induced apocalypse&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;.

Yet, it's not all doom and gloom. The dialogue around P(DOOM) also illuminates the path to P(WIN), a future where AI amplifies human potential and addresses some of our most intractable problems. This balance between catastrophic risk and transformative potential requires a nuanced understanding, akin to steering a ship through treacherous waters with the promise of new lands on the horizon.

Prominent figures such as Professor Yoshua Bengio, one of the "godfathers of AI," put their P(DOOM) around 20%, reflecting significant concern yet also an implicit belief in the potential for alignment and positive outcomes&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;. This juxtaposition of hope and fear encapsulates the current state of AI, where every advancement brings us closer to both potential outcomes.

As we navigate this uncertain future, the question of "What's your P(DOOM)?" serves not only as a barometer of individual outlooks but as a call to action. It beckons the brightest minds to work towards minimizing risks and maximizing benefits, ensuring AI's trajectory leads us towards a future marked by enhancement rather than extinction.

In conclusion, the evolution of P(DOOM) versus P(WIN) in AI is a narrative of human aspiration, fear, and hope. It's a reminder that our collective future with AI is not predetermined but is being shaped by the decisions we make today. As we ponder on P(DOOM), let's also kindle the fires of P(WIN) by fostering innovation that aligns with humanity's best interests, creating a legacy where AI becomes a pivotal ally in our quest for a better world.
