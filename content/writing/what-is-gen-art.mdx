# What is Generative Art?

Art may manifest generative qualities, intentionally or not, demonstrating the varied interpretations of what makes a work generative.

I advocate for definitions that encourage discourse on generative art rather than setting firm limits on what it may or may not be.

## Tentative Definitions

Consider:

**Generative Art**: Art brought to life through self-governing processes.

Clarifying an autonomous process:

**Autonomous Process**: A process that functions without direct human intervention.

## Organizing the Discussion

I suggest dividing autonomous processes into three categories: randomness, established rules, and natural systems. This article will delve into these categories, showcasing their role in generative art.

This categorization is not without its flaws, including overlaps and exclusions, yet it offers a framework to understand autonomy in art and to further examine generativity.

## The Core of Generation

Randomness is a key driver behind what we recognize as "generative art".

An artist's code might produce varied outputs based on the values of several variables, such as the quantity of circles, their positions, sizes, colors, etc.

In the forthcoming (work-in-progress) images, variables dictate the placement of nodes, their quantity, their connections to other nodes, and the characteristics of those connections.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/bw_simple_1.png" alt="bw_simple_1" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/bw_simple_2.png" alt="bw_simple_2" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/bw_simple_3.png" alt="bw_simple_3" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/bw_simple_4.png" alt="bw_simple_4" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
  </div>
</div>

Certainly, we _could_ preset variable values or manually tweak them through sliders, adopting a predominantly human-controlled, non-autonomous method. Such approaches are especially cumbersome when setting characteristics for thousands of nodes and stray from the core of generative art.

Embracing truly _generative_ art, we leverage functions like `random()` to enable the creation of varied images with each execution, thus producing diverse outcomes.

Vera Molnar, a trailblazer in generative art, extensively utilized randomness in her works. Viewing [this clip](https://vimeo.com/372579247) of her discussing her approach is quite enlightening.

## Pseudorandomness

Crucially, from both conceptual and technical perspectives, what we often regard as randomness is actually pseudorandomness.

Computers by their nature cannot select numbers at random. Yet, for artistic aims, we can generate numbers that are adequately random through pseudorandom number generators (prng).

A prng begins with an initial value, or "seed," and processes it with an algorithm to produce a number. The seed frequently comes from a variable element, such as the computer's timestamp.

Executing the algorithm across 10,000 unique seeds is expected to yield a uniform distribution of numbers between 0 and 1. This is exemplified in a p5js demonstration that displays 10,000 squares evenly spread across a canvas, their positions determined by the `random()` function.

![func_ran.png](/images/what-is-generative-art/func_ran.png)

The seed may also be fixed for testing or to achieve repeatable outcomes. In NFTs on platforms like [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Amy%20Goodchild) and [ArtBlocks](https://artblocks.io/), a blockchain transaction hash serves as the seed for the piece's randomness.

When supplied with the same seed, the algorithm consistently reproduces identical results, making the process deterministic rather than genuinely random.

## True Randomness

For certain applications, like banking and cryptography, generating truly random numbers is necessary. This can be achieved by tapping into a chaotic natural data source, such as [atmospheric noise](https://www.random.org/), captured by a radio, or the visual output from [lava lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand).
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/thunderstorm.png" alt="Thunderstorm" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/lava_lamp.png" alt="Lava Lamp" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
</div>

Utilizing truly random numbers in this manner is more complex than simply invoking `random()`, but conceptually, it presents an intriguing avenue to explore within a generative art project.

What impact does the nature of the number—random or pseudorandom—have on the final artwork? Does it alter the outcome significantly, if at all?

## A Philosophical Sidebar

We can label a pseudorandom number generator as deterministic and predictable, whereas numbers derived from natural sources are chaotic and unforeseeable.

Yet, the latter's unpredictability hinges on the universe's determinism. If we inhabit a deterministic universe, where each event results from preceding events, then no true randomness exists. Quantum mechanics challenges this notion, as subatomic particles exhibit behaviors that appear truly random and causeless. However, the discussion on [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) remains unsettled.

I aim to delve deeper into this topic in a future blog, as it unravels intriguing conceptual threads.

For now, we can assert that natural sources of chaotic data like atmospheric noise are unpredictable in practical terms, and [quantum](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-unpredictable-nature-quantum-mechanics-random.html) [random](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) [number](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95388-7) [generators](https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-mechanics-could-solve-cryptographys-random-number-problem/) may even be theoretically unpredictable.

## Distribution

A proficient prng should yield an even distribution of results. However, for artistic applications, skewing those results to an uneven distribution through mathematical functions can be beneficial.

[This sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/iverfinne/full/Ct8VRU1wZ) I crafted demonstrates this, utilizing functions from [easings.net](https://easings.net/) (originally intended for animation).

  </div>
</div>

## Other Algorithms

An alternative to pseudorandom number generators is procedural generation, like Perlin noise. While a prng delivers evenly distributed but unrelated results, Perlin noise creates sequentially akin outcomes.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/func_3.png" alt="Random Distribution" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/func_4.png" alt="Perlin Noise Distribution" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
</div>

Noise is a potent tool for crafting organic movements and forms. Below are two pieces from Amy Goodchild's [Genuary 2022](https://genuary.art/) collection, heavily reliant on noise for determining the variables' values.

## Final Thoughts on Randomness

Randomness raises profound philosophical questions, presenting a vast field for conceptual exploration.

Beyond these theoretical considerations, pseudorandomness and procedural generators like Perlin noise offer simple yet potent methods for generating varied and effective results.

## Instructions for Art

Sol LeWitt's work exemplifies one form of rule-based art. Some of his pieces consist of a set of instructions rather than their tangible outcomes.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_wall_drawing.png" alt="Sol LeWitt - Wall Drawing #118" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_proposal_for_wall_drawing.png" alt="Sol LeWitt - Proposal for Wall Drawing" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
</div>

LeWitt's instructions have been executed numerous times.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '33.33%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_Interactive_wall_drawing.png" alt="Genuary Day 7 - Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '33.33%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_wall_drawing_interactive.jpg" alt="Interactive Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '33.33%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_drawing_being_made_at_dia_beacon.png" alt="Sol LeWitt drawing being made at Dia Beacon" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
  </div>
</div>

The instructions offer both prescriptive and ambiguous guidance. When executed by humans, they can choose to adhere to or diverge from the instructions as they see fit.

Control over the outcome partially resides with LeWitt and partially with the executor, whether human or machine, paralleling the control distribution seen in much generative art.

## Following Instructions

In Studio Moniker's project [_Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red_](https://studiomoniker.com/projects/red-follows-yellow-follows-blue-follows-red), participants donning colored capes and headphones receive directives. For instance, individuals in red capes might be instructed to "follow yellow but avoid blue", while those in blue are told "follow red but avoid yellow".

In this human-centric experiment, most participants diligently follow the instructions, though some may interpret or disregard them to varying extents, altering the balance of control between the artists and the participants.

As each individual acts based on their unique instructions, patterns emerge across the group as a whole.

## Emergence

When the components of a system each possess distinct properties and behaviors, unforeseen and intriguing outcomes can emerge at the system level.

Emergence is a common phenomenon in nature, observable in weather systems, ant colonies, bird flocks, and more. We can craft our emergent systems by establishing rules for individual elements.

## Cellular Automata

Cellular automata represent a well-known emergent system, exemplified by Conway's Game of Life and Wolfram's rules.

Conway's Game of Life unfolds on a grid of cells, each marked as alive or dead at the outset (randomly or according to a pattern). In subsequent turns, each cell considers its eight neighbors to determine its new state based on specific rules:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if from underpopulation.
    
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next turn.
    
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if from overpopulation.
    
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
    
This process generates surprisingly intricate patterns across the entire grid, influenced by the initial arrangement.

</div>

You can explore my Conway's Game of Life implementation [here](https://editor.p5js.org/iverfinne/sketches/ObizzlZni). Remember to click the play button in the top left to start and review the controls at the top of the code.

These systems can be diversified and made more complex by increasing the number of possible states, altering the size and shape of the neighborhood, and experimenting with different rule sets. When the system cycles through multiple states, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2…, it is termed a Cyclic Cellular Automaton.


## Simulated Ecosystems

We can also move beyond the grid to create more dynamic emergent systems composed of moving entities. Each entity follows its own set of behaviors, often inspired by real-life phenomena such as flocking, reproduction, growth, consumption, death, and more.

Below are examples of creature systems I've developed, showcasing different aspects like flocking, avoidance, reproduction, repulsion, and consumption.

These entities move as a group and generate sounds when they come into proximity with one another.

I plan to delve deeper into the interdependence among ecosystem members. By incorporating birth and death cycles, food sources, and predators, we can observe an ecosystem flourishing or dwindling.

## Other Simulations

Artists often simulate real-world phenomena using algorithms based on concepts like reaction-diffusion, diffusion-limited aggregation, forces, snowflakes, tree growth, slime mold, and more.

Many complex real-world systems and phenomena can be modeled by simulating the governing rules of their components and the variables affecting them.

Diffusion-limited aggregation simulation by [Andy Lomas](https://www.instagram.com/andylomasart/)

Simulations can range in their level of abstraction, forming a gradient from art to science. Some works are loosely inspired by natural phenomena, while others aim to closely model and investigate the real world.

Consider these two sets of snowflakes. The first image presents outputs from [Snowflaker](https://www.misha.studio/snowflaker/), generating simple yet appealing snowflake SVGs. The second showcases [Gravner-Griffeath](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/in-silico-flurries/) snowflakes (interactive example [here](https://cruzgodar.com/applets/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes.html)), created by accurately modeling crystal growth under various conditions.

  </div>
</div>


## Growing Art

In Magical Contamination, Antoine Bridier-Nahmias curates petri dishes of microorganisms. Similar to how Gravner-Griffeath’s snowflakes are defined by a set of modeled variables, here the artist influences the outcomes by controlling conditions like oxygen levels, light, and temperature, affecting the growth of the mold. 

The key difference is that Magical Contamination occurs in the real world, being less precise, more chaotic, and of higher resolution than a simulation. (Or perhaps, the simulation we perceive as the real world is…)

  </div>
</div>


## Mathematics

Mathematics plays a significant role in rule-based systems. Geometry and trigonometry are indispensable for many projects I undertake, with SOHCAHTOA frequently coming into play and reminding me of my regret for not pursuing mathematics more fervently.

Math truly excels in Dave Whyte's creations:  

I recommend [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41739506-math-art) for those interested in exploring mathematical algorithms that lend themselves to visual art.

## The Algorithm is the Idea

Some concepts manifest as "what if it did this, then that… what would it look like?" The idea _becomes_ the algorithm—a series of steps.

In the pen-plotted works from Casey Reas' series [_RGB-3_](https://reas.com/rgb_3/), the titles' three angles describe the red, green, and blue lines' angles. Some line areas are omitted, creating different crossover effects.

</div>


## Final Reflections on Rules

This article and my explorations thus far have merely scratched the surface of rule-based generation's potential.

Some key insights from this section:

*   Various methods exist for setting and implementing rules.
    
*   Rules applied at an individual level can lead to unexpected emergent phenomena at the system level.

# Additional Considerations

As noted initially, categorization overlaps and omissions abound. Let's examine a few aspects not covered thus far.

## Data Sources and Inputs

We've discussed using chaotic data sources as true random number generators, but what about employing non-chaotic data sources?

Some projects in this genre exhibit clear overlaps with data visualization, like Aaron Koblin's [_Flight Patterns_](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns/), visualizing air traffic across North America. Meanwhile, in Maria Takeuchi and Frederico Phillips' film [_Asphyxia_](http://www.asphyxia-project.com/), a Kinect captures dancer Shiho Tanaka's movements to generate a 3D rendered structure. Here, the output remains representational of the input but in a less data-driven manner.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>

    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Flight Patterns (2010) - Aaron Koblin</p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/asphyxia.jpg" alt="Asphyxia (2015) - Maria Takeuchi , Frederico Phillips, performed by Shiho Tanaka" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Asphyxia (2015) - Maria Takeuchi , Frederico Phillips, performed by Shiho Tanaka</p>
  </div>
</div>

A "data source" can also be analogously applied to an output, as in Charles Sowers' [_Windswept_](https://www.charlessowers.com/new-page-1), where 612 freely rotating metal arrows are spun by the wind, resulting in patterns reminiscent of Vera Molnar's Interruptions.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/charles_sowers_windswept_1.png" alt="Windswept (2011) - Charles Sowers" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />

    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Windswept (2011) - Charles Sowers</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Artificial Intelligence

Art that incorporates machine learning exists alongside generative art, yet surprisingly, they are seldom considered related. Nonetheless, outputs from AI are undeniably generative. A machine learning algorithm operates through a complex rule system and could arguably be discussed in the Rules section, though ML/AI art arguably constitutes its own category.

A machine learning algorithm requires a dataset for training. In Anna Ridler's work [_Myriad (Tulips)_](http://annaridler.com/myriad-tulips), she manually created her dataset by capturing 10,000 photographs of tulips. Subsequently, in [_Mosaic Virus_](http://annaridler.com/mosaic-virus), she trained a GAN (generative adversarial network) on this dataset to produce new tulip images.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/myriad_tulips.jpg" alt="Myriad (Tulips) (2018) - Anna Ridler" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Myriad (Tulips) (2018) - Anna Ridler</p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/mosaic_virus.jpg" alt="Mosaic Virus (2019) - Anna Ridler" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Mosaic Virus (2019) - Anna Ridler</p>
  </div>
</div>

In many cases (both AI and non-AI), a data source is a byproduct of another process—naturally occurring information that needs to be captured and organized. When considering the balance of control in the output, the data source largely falls outside the artist's control, while they do maintain control over how that data is manipulated and utilized for the final output.

Ridler's project differs in that she exerted significant control over the dataset, leaving the outcomes to the GAN's internal mechanisms.

## Automatism

The surrealists employed a technique known as automatic drawing, allowing the hand to move "randomly" across a page. For many, this was a means for the artist's subconscious to express itself, while for early abstract artist Hilma Af Klint, it was a method for communicating with the spirit world during séances.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/hilma_af_klint_the_five.png" alt="A collective automatic drawing by The Five, Hilma af Klint's spiritualist group" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>A collective automatic drawing by The Five, Hilma af Klint's spiritualist group</p>

    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>The Smile of the Flamboyant Wings (1953) - Joan Miró</p>
  </div>
</div>

Previously, I defined generative art as creations "not under direct human control", so including automatism may stretch that definition. However, if artists are indeed accessing their subconscious (or, indeed, the spirit world), then this work is not under their direct control. Perhaps the subconscious can be considered a random source.

Considering the balance of control prevalent in many generative artworks, between the artist and the computer, or between the artist and a participant; the relationship between the artist and their own subconscious might be viewed in a similar light. When ideas arise, where do they originate? If the idea is an impulse to draw in one direction or another, is that system any less chaotic than the weather?

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/paul_emile_borduas_untitled.webp" alt="Untitled (1954-55) - Paul Emile Borduas" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Untitled (1954-55) - Paul Emile Borduas</p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/max_ernst_forest_and_dove.jpg" alt="Forest and Dove (1927) - Max Ernst Uses grattage technique" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Forest and Dove (1927) - Max Ernst Uses grattage technique</p>
  </div>
</div>

Some automatists created entire pieces at the whim of their subconscious, while other artists used this technique to initiate a piece, subsequently shifting towards more figurative or composed imagery as it emerged. [Automatism](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism) led to methods that introduced chance and spontaneity into creation and mark-making, like collage, pencil rubbings (frottage), and paint scraping (grattage).

This segue leads us to the next topic:

## Painting and Drawing

At the outset, I mentioned that traditional painting could be considered generative. This holds true in two respects - first, when automatism plays a part in the artist's process, and second, when the physical act of applying paint to canvas incorporates elements of chance.

[Jackson Pollock](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/jackson-pollock-1785)'s action paintings are a prime example of both factors. Influenced by automatism, his work was not devised according to a preconceived plan. Instead, it emerged from the act of painting itself, relinquishing control to the moment. The dynamic, unrestricted nature of his drip technique means that natural phenomena, such as fluid dynamics, introduced randomness into the results.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '80%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/images/what-is-generative-art/jackson_pollock_alchemy.png" alt="Alchemy (1947) - Jackson Pollock" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>Alchemy (1947) - Jackson Pollock</p>
  </div>
</div>

Rather than viewing paintings as either embodying these generative elements or not, I prefer to consider it a spectrum. Some paintings are meticulously and consciously controlled by the artist, others are significantly influenced by chance, and many lie somewhere in between. The artist's intent and perspective also play a crucial role in determining whether their work is considered generative.

## Conclusion

When contemplating generative art, we often think of p5js sketches, Vera Molnar's plotter drawings, and flow fields. While these are dear to me, a deeper exploration reveals a wealth of other areas to explore. I'm confident there are additional examples and perspectives I've yet to include!

Navigating the categories above, I frequently found examples or concepts that could fit into multiple sections. The intersection and remixing of elements and ideas from each category present myriad opportunities for new artworks.

The conceptual scope of considering the boundaries between chance and the outcome of a series of steps, the origins of ideas and randomness, the presence of generativity in nature, the definition of what is not generative, the nature of simulations, and more, is vast.

Generative art is not a novel genre, but it is experiencing a resurgence. We're still exploring the breadth of what's possible. I look forward to witnessing (and contributing to) work that navigates these paths and addresses these conceptual queries.
